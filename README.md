### for NES/NESASM  

This program is a grafting of a sample program written by a NES beginner. It was burned in flash ROM and confirmed the operation on the actual equipment of the NES.  
In addition, there are traps that do not work on the real machine only by checking with the emulator, because various RAMs are cleared to zero in the emulator. Let's clear the work RAM and VRAM.
